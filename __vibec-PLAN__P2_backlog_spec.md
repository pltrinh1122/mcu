- Created: 2025-08-09T20:26:34Z
- Owner: Operator
- Status: ARCHIVE
- Scope: reference/MCU_BACKLOG_SPECIFICATION.md
- Orchestration: false
- Plan_Level: 1

## Objective
Create a specification for `backlog` MCU type.

## Steps
1. Define metadata, content structure, and quality standards
2. Specify composition relationship to Backlog Items

## Validation
- markdownlint (MD013 disabled)
- Key Consistency: `orchestration: false` must pair with `plan_level: 1`

## Risks
- Overlap with PLAN/STATUS; mitigate via clear boundaries

## Success Criteria
- Spec file created with required sections
