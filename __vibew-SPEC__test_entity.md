## Section 1: Entity Metadata

```yaml
entity_metadata:
  entity_name: "Test"
  entity_type: "concrete"
  parent_class: "QualityEntity"
  category: "Quality"
  
  mcu_compliance:
    inherits_from: "WorkActivityEntity → QualityEntity → Test"
    compliance_level: "full"
    validation_status: "validated"
```

## Section 2: Entity Definition

```yaml
entity_definition:
  primary_purpose:
    description: "Functional verification and performance assessment to ensure artifacts work as intended"
    scope: "Systematic testing of artifact functionality, performance, and integration characteristics"
    differentiation: "Focuses on functional verification, distinct from Validate (standards) and Review (stakeholder alignment)"
  
  outcome_specification:
    primary_outcome: "Confirmation of artifact functionality and performance characteristics"
    outcome_format: "Test results with functionality verification, performance metrics, and issue identification"
    success_criteria: 
      - "All critical functionality tested and verified"
      - "Performance meets specified requirements"
      - "Integration points tested and working"
      - "Test coverage adequate for artifact complexity"
    quality_standards:
      - "Comprehensive test coverage of critical functions"
      - "Realistic test scenarios and conditions"
      - "Reproducible test procedures"
      - "Clear pass/fail criteria"
```

## Section 3: Implementation Specification (Abbreviated)

```yaml
ai_agent_implementation:
  autonomous_capabilities:
    - "Execute standard test procedures and frameworks"
    - "Run automated tests where available"
    - "Document test results systematically"
    - "Identify functional issues and performance problems"
  
  operator_required:
    - "Define test scope and success criteria"
    - "Approve test approaches for complex functionality"
    - "Review test results for critical systems"
    - "Authorize deployment based on test outcomes"
```

## Section 4: Workflow Integration

```yaml
workflow_integration:
  composition_patterns:
    typical_workflows:
      - workflow_name: "Test-Driven Quality Assurance"
        sequence: "Create → Validate → Test → Review → Commit"
        description: "Comprehensive testing before stakeholder review"
      
      - workflow_name: "Iterative Testing and Refinement"
        sequence: "Draft → Test → Refine → Test → Create → Validate → Commit"
        description: "Testing guides iterative improvement"
```

## Conclusion

The Test entity ensures artifacts function correctly and meet performance requirements through systematic verification. As a Quality category entity, Test provides essential quality assurance through functional and performance testing.
