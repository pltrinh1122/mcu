## Section 1: Entity Metadata

```yaml
entity_metadata:
  entity_name: "Validate"
  entity_type: "concrete"
  parent_class: "QualityEntity"
  category: "Quality"
  
  mcu_compliance:
    inherits_from: "WorkActivityEntity → QualityEntity → Validate"
    compliance_level: "full"
    validation_status: "validated"
```

## Section 2: Entity Definition

```yaml
entity_definition:
  primary_purpose:
    description: "Quality and standards verification to ensure artifacts meet specified requirements and compliance criteria"
    scope: "Systematic checking of artifacts against established standards, requirements, and quality criteria"
    differentiation: "Focuses on standards compliance, distinct from Test (functionality) and Review (stakeholder alignment)"
  
  outcome_specification:
    primary_outcome: "Confirmation of artifact compliance with established standards and requirements"
    outcome_format: "Validation report with compliance status, identified issues, and recommendations"
    success_criteria: 
      - "All applicable standards checked systematically"
      - "Compliance status clearly documented"
      - "Non-compliance issues identified with recommendations"
      - "Validation methodology documented for reproducibility"
    quality_standards:
      - "Comprehensive coverage of applicable standards"
      - "Objective and consistent validation criteria"
      - "Clear documentation of findings"
      - "Actionable recommendations for issues"
```

## Section 3: Implementation Specification (Abbreviated)

```yaml
ai_agent_implementation:
  autonomous_capabilities:
    - "Apply standard validation checklists and criteria"
    - "Run automated validation tools where available"
    - "Document compliance status systematically"
    - "Generate standardized validation reports"
  
  operator_required:
    - "Define validation scope and applicable standards"
    - "Approve validation criteria for complex situations"
    - "Review validation results for critical artifacts"
    - "Authorize remediation approaches for non-compliance"
```

## Section 4: Workflow Integration

```yaml
workflow_integration:
  composition_patterns:
    typical_workflows:
      - workflow_name: "Quality-First Creation"
        sequence: "Create → Validate → Test → Review → Commit"
        description: "Systematic quality assurance before deployment"
      
      - workflow_name: "Continuous Validation"
        sequence: "Draft → Validate → Refine → Validate → Create → Test → Commit"
        description: "Validation throughout development process"
```

## Conclusion

The Validate entity ensures artifacts meet established standards and requirements through systematic verification. As a Quality category entity, Validate provides essential quality assurance through standards compliance checking.
