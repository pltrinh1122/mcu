- Created: 2025-08-09T20:26:34Z
- Owner: Operator
- Status: ARCHIVE
- Scope: reference/MCU_BACKLOG_ITEM_SPECIFICATION.md
- Orchestration: false
- Plan_Level: 1

## Objective
Create a specification for `backlog-item` MCU type.

## Steps
1. Define metadata, content structure, and quality standards
2. Require source references and optional execution links (PLAN, STATUS)

## Validation
- markdownlint (MD013 disabled)
- Key Consistency: `orchestration: false` must pair with `plan_level: 1`

## Risks
- Incomplete lineage; mitigate by requiring at least one source reference

## Success Criteria
- Spec file created with required sections
