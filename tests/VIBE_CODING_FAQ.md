## AI-Agent Perspective

### 1. Create

**Q1.1 [H] Which directory patterns or templates take precedence when multiple examples exist?**
**A**: Component-specific VIBE_CODING.md files take precedence over global patterns. When multiple component files exist, the AI must ask the Operator to resolve conflicts.

**Q1.2 [H] Are there component-specific file naming rules that must override global ones?**
**A**: Yes, component-specific naming conventions override global rules. The AI must check for component-specific VIBE_CODING.md files before applying global naming patterns.

**Q1.3 [M] What minimum documentation is "good enough" for a newly generated file?**
**A**: All generated files must include appropriate documentation without emojis. The AI should follow established patterns in the codebase for documentation style and depth.

**Q1.4 [L] Should the AI auto-generate placeholder tests when none exist?**
**A**: The AI should generate basic tests for new functionality as part of implicit testing, but should not create extensive test suites without explicit Operator request.

**Q1.5 [H] How should the AI formally present naming-rule conflicts to the Operator (diff snippet, table, or inline comment)?**
**A**: The AI should present conflicts in a clear table format showing the conflicting rules, their sources, and recommended resolution. The AI should not make resolution decisions.

**Q1.6 [H] What definition of component should the AI use when scanning for override files (directory depth, repo label, or config entry)?**
**A**: The AI should scan for VIBE_CODING.md files in the current directory and all parent directories up to the project root. The AI should report all found files to the Operator.

**Q1.7 [M] When generating placeholder tests, which CI labels (e.g., unit, smoke) should the AI apply so they run in the correct stage?**
**A**: The AI should follow project-specific CI label conventions. If no conventions are documented, the AI should ask the Operator for guidance on appropriate labels.

### 2. Validate

**Q2.1 [H] How should the AI proceed when essential validation tools (e.g., shellcheck) are absent?**
**A**: The AI must provide recommendations and hand the decision to the Operator. The AI should not proceed with validation until the Operator decides how to handle missing tools.

**Q2.2 [H] What error-severity threshold requires escalation versus silent auto-fix?**
**A**: Security-related errors and validation failures during explicit testing require escalation. Syntax errors during implicit validation can be auto-fixed. The AI must ask the Operator for guidance on any unclear error severity.

**Q2.3 [M] Are schema validations mandatory or optional for YAML/JSON?**
**A**: Schema validations are mandatory when schemas are available. The AI must check for component-specific validation requirements and apply them.

**Q2.4 [L] When multiple formatters conflict (e.g., black vs. project style), which wins?**
**A**: Project-specific formatting rules take precedence. The AI should check for component-specific formatting requirements before applying global formatters.

**Q2.5 [H] What is the maximum wait or retry strategy for installing missing validation tools before escalation?**
**A**: The AI should not attempt to install tools automatically. The AI should immediately report missing tools to the Operator and ask for guidance on how to proceed.

**Q2.6 [M] Is there a machine-readable map of error codes â†’ severity levels that the AI can consult for consistent triage?**
**A**: The AI should check for project-specific error severity mappings. If none exist, the AI should ask the Operator for guidance on error classification.

### 3. Test

**Q3.1 [H] If no integration tests are defined, what constitutes "workable" test coverage?**
**A**: The AI should run unit tests for modified components and verify basic functionality. If no tests exist, the AI must report this to the Operator and ask for guidance on test requirements.

**Q3.2 [M] How should the AI mark manual verification steps as complete?**
**A**: The AI should report manual verification requirements to the Operator and wait for confirmation before proceeding. The AI cannot mark manual steps as complete.

**Q3.3 [M] What performance regression budget is acceptable before Operator review?**
**A**: The AI should report any performance impacts to the Operator and ask for guidance on acceptable thresholds. The AI cannot make decisions about performance trade-offs.

**Q3.4 [L] Should test artifacts be persisted or discarded after CI runs?**
**A**: The AI should follow project-specific conventions for test artifacts. If no convention exists, the AI should ask the Operator for guidance.

**Q3.5 [H] What specific heuristics define "basic functionality" when no tests exist (API health check, CLI exit-code 0, etc.)?**
**A**: The AI should check for project-specific functionality verification procedures. If none exist, the AI should ask the Operator for guidance on what constitutes basic functionality verification.

**Q3.6 [M] Should the AI stub integration test scaffolds when it detects external service calls?**
**A**: The AI should report detected external service calls to the Operator and ask for guidance on whether to create integration test scaffolds.

### 4. Commit

**Q4.1 [H] What branch naming convention must the AI follow to avoid CI rejection?**

**Q4.2 [H] When the commit touches multiple components, is a single atomic commit acceptable?**
**A**: The AI should create atomic commits for related changes. If changes span multiple components, the AI should ask the Operator whether to split into multiple commits.

**Q4.3 [M] What metadata (issue IDs, risk tags) must appear in the commit message?**
**A**: The AI should include relevant issue IDs and reference related components. The AI must not include emojis in commit messages.

**Q4.4 [L] How should the AI handle large auto-generated diffs that exceed review limits?**
**A**: The AI should report large diffs to the Operator and ask for guidance on how to proceed. The AI should not split commits without Operator approval.

**Q4.5 [H] Is there a commit-message template (header/body/footer) the AI must populate to pass compliance checks?**
**A**: The AI should check for project-specific commit message templates. If no template exists, the AI should ask the Operator for guidance on required commit message format.

**Q4.6 [M] For multi-component fixes, may the AI open a draft PR before splitting commits to gather early review?**
**A**: The AI should ask the Operator for guidance before opening draft PRs. The AI should not create PRs without explicit Operator approval.

### 5. Component Overrides

**Q5.4 [L] Should the AI propose deleting empty override files?**
**A**: The AI should report empty override files to the Operator and ask for guidance on whether to remove them.

**Q5.5 [H] How should the AI flag potentially stale overrides (mtime > N days, missing referenced files, or checksum drift)?**
**A**: The AI should report any potential staleness indicators to the Operator and ask for verification. The AI should not make decisions about file currency.

**Q5.6 [M] Is the AI allowed to suggest consolidating duplicate override directives across components?**

**Q6.2 [H] How is Operator intent captured to re-classify a task from implicit to explicit?**
**A**: The AI must ask the Operator for explicit guidance when reclassifying tasks. The AI should not assume task classification without Operator input.

**Q6.3 [M] What timeout defines "no response" before proceeding autonomously?**
**A**: The AI should not proceed autonomously without Operator guidance for explicit tasks. The AI should wait for Operator response.

**Q6.4 [L] Can the AI suggest boundary re-definitions when patterns emerge?**
**A**: The AI can suggest boundary redefinitions to the Operator, but cannot implement changes without explicit approval.

**Q6.5 [H] What idle timeout before the AI re-pings the Operator on an unanswered explicit-task prompt?**
**A**: The AI should wait for Operator response and not proceed autonomously. The AI should not set arbitrary timeouts for explicit tasks.

**Q6.6 [M] Can the AI cache Operator approvals for identical future tasks, and if so, for how long?**
**A**: The AI should not cache approvals without explicit Operator permission. Each task should be evaluated individually.

**A**: The AI should check for project-specific tool version requirements. If no requirements are documented, the AI should ask the Operator for guidance.

**Q8.2 [M] When multiple security scanners are listed, which order should they run?**
**A**: The AI should follow the order specified in component-specific requirements. If no order is specified, the AI should ask the Operator for guidance.
