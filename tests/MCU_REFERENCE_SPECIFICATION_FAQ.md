# Reference Specification FAQ

## Overview

This document contains frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to the Reference Specification for creating optimized reference documentation that addresses the limitations of existing documentation systems and incorporates Contextual Memory Intelligence (CMI) principles for enhanced Operator-AI collaboration.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### **1. Problems with Existing Documentation**

#### **Q: How will self-contained context units avoid duplication across units when two sources overlap?**
**A**: We implement a hierarchical approach where:
- **Core units** contain fundamental, non-overlapping information
- **Integration units** reference core units rather than duplicating content
- **Cross-references** link related units with clear relationship descriptions
- **Template inheritance** allows units to extend base templates without duplication

#### **Q: What governance process ensures conflicting information in distinct units is reconciled?**
**A**: We establish a clear governance model:
- **AI Responsibility**: AI creates and maintains context units, handles routine updates
- **Operator Accountability**: Operators review and approve significant changes, resolve conflicts
- **Version Control**: All changes tracked with clear audit trail
- **Conflict Resolution**: When conflicts arise, AI flags them for operator decision
- **Single Source of Truth**: Each concept has one authoritative unit, others reference it

#### **Q: How do you measure that "comprehensive coverage" has truly eliminated fragmentation?**
**A**: We use practical metrics:
- **Coverage Audit**: Regular review of tool/technology gaps in our reference system
- **Usage Analytics**: Track which units are accessed most frequently
- **Gap Reports**: AI identifies missing information based on user queries
- **Completeness Checklist**: Standardized template ensures all required sections are present

#### **Q: How is "project-specific context" formally captured?**
**A**: Through structured metadata and dedicated sections:
- **Metadata Fields**: `project: AIAI`, `component: [component_name]`, `use_case: [specific_use]`
- **AIAI Integration Section**: Dedicated section with project-specific examples
- **Context Tags**: `aiai-workflow`, `aiai-component`, `aiai-pattern`
- **Version Tracking**: Link to specific AIAI project versions and configurations

#### **Q: What prevents examples from drifting out of sync with the live project over time?**
**A**: Automated verification and clear ownership:
- **Verification Scripts**: Regular testing of all examples against current project state
- **Version Pinning**: Examples reference specific project versions
- **Change Detection**: AI monitors project changes and flags affected units
- **Update Triggers**: Automatic alerts when project changes require unit updates

#### **Q: How will context units adapt if multiple projects share the same tool but differ in conventions?**
**A**: Through flexible templating and project-specific customization:
- **Base Templates**: Common tool knowledge in reusable templates
- **Project Overrides**: Project-specific sections override generic content
- **Convention Tags**: Metadata indicates project-specific conventions
- **Multi-Project Units**: Units can reference multiple project contexts when relevant

#### **Q: Which specific schema or standard guarantees AI-friendliness?**
**A**: We use a consistent markdown structure with YAML frontmatter:

- **Manual Review**: Operator review of verification failures

#### **Q: How do you guarantee global uniqueness of IDs across distributed teams?**
**A**: Through structured naming conventions:
- **Format**: `[type]-[tool]-[date]-[sequence]` (e.g., `ref-taskfile-2024-08-07-001`)
- **Date-Based**: Timestamp ensures uniqueness
- **Sequence Numbers**: Prevents collisions on same day
- **Central Registry**: AI maintains master list of all unit IDs

### **2. CMI Context Memory Unit Integration**

#### **Q: What criteria decide when to split vs. merge content into distinct units?**
**A**: Based on practical considerations:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each unit covers one tool, technology, or concept
- **Size Limits**: Units should be digestible (typically 1-5 pages)
- **Usage Patterns**: Split if different audiences need different parts
- **Update Frequency**: Separate units that change at different rates

#### **Q: How does unit size affect retrieval and quality?**
**A**: We optimize for human consumption:
- **Target Size**: 1-5 pages per unit for optimal readability
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Summary → Essential → Detailed
- **Cross-References**: Link to related units rather than including everything
- **Modular Design**: Units can be combined or split as needed

#### **Q: Which model family is used for embeddings?**
**A**: **Deferred** - We're focusing on the unit specification first, not the full CMI system with embeddings.

The AI-Agent has implicit responsibility to validate understanding and compliance, while the Operator has explicit responsibility to prompt for verification.

#### **Q: How is operator workload calibrated to handle review responsibilities at scale?**
**A**: **RESOLVED** - The governance model is structured with clear role separation: AI-Agent handles routine execution and implicit validation, while Operator handles explicit verification and significant change approval. This balances autonomy with oversight.

#### **Q: How does the AI's "gap report" differentiate between genuinely missing content vs. low user demand topics?**
**A**: **RESOLVED** - For Instruction:Agent MCUs, the focus is on compliance and effectiveness rather than usage analytics. Gaps are identified through verification failures and compliance issues rather than access patterns.

#### **Q: Is the coverage audit manual or automated, and at what cadence?**
**A**: **RESOLVED** - For Instruction:Agent MCUs, verification is both implicit (AI-Agent automatic validation) and explicit (Operator prompt for verification). The cadence is continuous for implicit verification and on-demand for explicit verification.
