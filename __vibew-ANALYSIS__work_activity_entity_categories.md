## Conclusion

The categorization analysis successfully organizes all 10 Work Activity Entities into 5 orthogonal categories with clear purposes, distinct boundaries, and well-defined relationships. The framework provides a solid foundation for inheritance hierarchy design while maintaining practical applicability for workflow composition.

The orthogonal relationship validation confirms that each category serves a unique purpose without overlap, while coverage analysis confirms that all workflow needs are addressed without gaps or redundancies.

**Next Steps**: Proceed to Activity 1.2 - Inheritance Hierarchy Definition using this categorization framework as the foundation.
