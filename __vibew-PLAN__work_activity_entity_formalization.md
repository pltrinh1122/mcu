## Conclusion

This plan formalizes the Work Activity Entity framework that emerged from our collaborative Align process. The framework provides a structured, extensible foundation for Vibe-Work subclasses while maintaining compliance with MCU hierarchy standards.

The plan ensures that the organic discovery process we demonstrated can be systematized and repeated, creating a living framework that evolves based on actual workflow needs while maintaining consistency and quality standards.

**Approval Required**: This plan extends Phase 0 by approximately 8 hours to complete Work Activity Entity formalization before proceeding to Phase 1 implementation. Operator approval requested for this extension and the proposed framework approach.

## Next Actions Upon Approval

1. **Begin Phase 1**: Entity categorization and hierarchy design
2. **Create Analysis Documents**: Systematic documentation of entity relationships
3. **Develop Specifications**: Formal specifications for all 10 entities
4. **Design Workflow Framework**: Composition rules and subclass guidance
5. **Validate Integration**: Ensure MCU compliance and implementation readiness

This plan provides the structured approach needed to formalize our collaborative discovery into a robust, extensible framework for VIBEWORK implementation.
