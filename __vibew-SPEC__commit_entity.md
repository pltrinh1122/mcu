## Section 1: Entity Metadata

```yaml
entity_metadata:
  entity_name: "Commit"
  entity_type: "concrete"
  parent_class: "FinalizationEntity"
  category: "Finalization"
  
  mcu_compliance:
    inherits_from: "WorkActivityEntity → FinalizationEntity → Commit"
    compliance_level: "full"
    validation_status: "validated"
```

## Section 2: Entity Definition

```yaml
entity_definition:
  primary_purpose:
    description: "Final persistence and completion of work artifacts for operational use and long-term availability"
    scope: "Finalizing work products and making them permanently available for intended use"
    differentiation: "Focuses on work completion and persistence, distinct from all other entities which produce work-in-progress"
  
  outcome_specification:
    primary_outcome: "Completed work formally recorded and available for operational use"
    outcome_format: "Persistent work artifacts with proper versioning, documentation, and access provisioning"
    success_criteria: 
      - "All work artifacts properly stored and versioned"
      - "Access permissions and availability configured"
      - "Documentation complete and accessible"
      - "Operational transition completed successfully"
    quality_standards:
      - "Permanent and reliable storage"
      - "Appropriate access controls and permissions"
      - "Complete audit trail and version history"
      - "Professional presentation and organization"
```

## Section 3: Implementation Specification (Abbreviated)

```yaml
ai_agent_implementation:
  autonomous_capabilities:
    - "Store work artifacts in appropriate persistent locations"
    - "Generate version information and commit messages"
    - "Apply standard access permissions and controls"
    - "Create completion documentation and summaries"
  
  operator_required:
    - "Approve final work completion and quality"
    - "Authorize operational deployment and access"
    - "Validate completion against original objectives"
    - "Approve transition to operational use"
```

## Section 4: Workflow Integration

```yaml
workflow_integration:
  composition_patterns:
    typical_workflows:
      - workflow_name: "Quality-Assured Completion"
        sequence: "Create → Validate → Test → Review → Commit"
        description: "Comprehensive quality assurance before finalization"
      
      - workflow_name: "Iterative Development Completion"
        sequence: "Plan → Draft → Refine → Create → Validate → Test → Commit"
        description: "Iterative development leading to final completion"
```

## Conclusion

The Commit entity provides final work persistence and operational transition capabilities. As the sole Finalization category entity, Commit serves as the universal completion mechanism for all work activities.

**Universal Application**: Commit appears as the final step in virtually all workflows, marking the transition from work-in-progress to completed operational artifacts.
