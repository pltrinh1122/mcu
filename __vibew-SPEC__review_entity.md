      - "Approval for progression obtained"
    quality_standards:
      - "Systematic comparison against alignment outputs"
      - "Comprehensive stakeholder input collection"
      - "Clear approval/rejection decisions"
      - "Actionable feedback for improvements"
```

## Section 3: Implementation Specification (Abbreviated)

```yaml
ai_agent_implementation:
  autonomous_capabilities:
    - "Compare artifacts against documented alignment outputs"
    - "Identify potential alignment gaps systematically"
    - "Prepare review materials and summaries"
    - "Document stakeholder feedback systematically"
  
  operator_required:
    - "Conduct stakeholder review sessions"
    - "Interpret alignment compliance in complex cases"

## Section 4: Workflow Integration

```yaml
workflow_integration:
  composition_patterns:
    typical_workflows:
      - workflow_name: "Stakeholder-Validated Delivery"
        sequence: "Create → Validate → Test → Review → Commit"
        description: "Complete quality assurance including stakeholder validation"
      
      - workflow_name: "Alignment-Driven Development"
        sequence: "Align → Plan → Create → Review → Refine → Review → Commit"
        description: "Alignment guides development with validation checkpoints"
```

## Conclusion

The Review entity ensures artifacts meet stakeholder expectations and alignment agreements through systematic stakeholder validation. As a Quality category entity, Review provides essential quality assurance through alignment compliance verification.

**Meta-Application Note**: This Review entity specification will itself be subject to Review entity validation when we transition from Draft activity to Review activity at the end of Phase 2.

_This specification implements the Work Activity Entity framework standards for Review entity implementation within the VIBEWORK ecosystem._
