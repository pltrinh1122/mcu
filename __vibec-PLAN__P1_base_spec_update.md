- Owner: Operator
- Status: Draft
- Scope: docs/MCU_SPECIFICATION.md
- Orchestration: false
- Plan_Level: 1

## Objective
Add `backlog` and `backlog-item` to types and inheritance diagram.

## Steps
1. Update type lists and metadata examples
2. Extend inheritance diagram to include Backlog and Backlog Item

## Validation
- markdownlint (MD013 disabled)

## Risks
- Diagram consistency; mitigate by cross-review

## Success Criteria
