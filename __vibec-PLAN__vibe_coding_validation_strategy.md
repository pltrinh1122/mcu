## Executive Summary

**TL;DR**: This plan outlines a comprehensive strategy to validate VIBE_CODING for conflicting instructions, particularly addressing the mix of declarative and imperative rules. The validation will identify conflicts, ensure consistency, and establish clear precedence rules for different instruction types. Each phase produces detailed analysis artifacts for Operator review.

**Key Points**:
- **Current State**: Mix of declarative and imperative rules without clear conflict resolution
- **Target State**: Validated, conflict-free instruction set with clear precedence rules
- **Timeline**: 4-phase validation over 2-3 development sessions
- **Quality Standards**: 100% conflict resolution, clear precedence hierarchy, consistent rule structure
- **Risk Mitigation**: Systematic analysis with rollback capability
- **Analysis Artifacts**: 11 detailed analysis documents generated during execution

---

## Current State Analysis

### **Instruction Types Identified**
- **Declarative Rules**: "AI should..." statements defining behavior expectations
- **Imperative Rules**: "Do this..." statements requiring specific actions
- **Procedural Rules**: Step-by-step instructions for specific workflows
- **Conditional Rules**: "If X, then Y" statements with branching logic

### **Potential Conflict Areas**
- **Autonomous vs. Explicit Actions**: When AI can act independently vs. requiring Operator approval
- **Timing Conflicts**: When rules specify different timing for similar actions
- **Precedence Conflicts**: When multiple rules apply to the same situation
- **Scope Conflicts**: When rules have overlapping but different scopes
- **Quality Standard Conflicts**: When different rules specify different quality requirements

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### **Step 1: Rule Classification System**

#### **Rule Type Definitions**
```markdown
**Declarative Rules**: Define what should be true or expected
- Format: "AI should..." or "The system should..."
- Purpose: Set expectations and standards
- Example: "AI should maintain professional tone in all communications"

**Imperative Rules**: Define specific actions to take
- Format: "Do X" or "Perform Y"
- Purpose: Specify required behaviors
- Example: "Prompt for Operator approval before cleaning up completed files"

**Procedural Rules**: Define step-by-step processes
- Format: "Step 1: X, Step 2: Y..."
- Purpose: Guide workflow execution
- Example: "Create → Validate → Test → Commit workflow"

**Conditional Rules**: Define branching logic
- Format: "If X, then Y" or "When X occurs, do Y"
- Purpose: Handle specific scenarios
- Example: "If validation fails, provide analysis and ask Operator for guidance"
```

#### **Conflict Detection Criteria**
```markdown
**Direct Conflicts**: Contradictory instructions
- Example: "Always do X" vs "Never do X"

**Timing Conflicts**: Different timing for same action
- Example: "Do X immediately" vs "Do X after approval"

**Scope Conflicts**: Overlapping but different scopes
- Example: "Do X for all files" vs "Do X only for Python files"

**Quality Conflicts**: Different quality standards
- Example: "Maintain 80% coverage" vs "Maintain 90% coverage"
```

### **Step 2: Automated Conflict Detection**

#### **Conflict Scanning Process**
```python
# Pseudo-code for conflict detection
def scan_conflicts():
    conflicts = []
    
    # Scan for direct contradictions
    for rule1 in declarative_rules:
        for rule2 in imperative_rules:
            if contradicts(rule1, rule2):
                conflicts.append(Conflict(rule1, rule2, "direct"))
    
    # Scan for timing conflicts
    for rule1 in timing_rules:
        for rule2 in timing_rules:
            if timing_conflict(rule1, rule2):
                conflicts.append(Conflict(rule1, rule2, "timing"))
    
    # Scan for scope conflicts
    for rule1 in scope_rules:
        for rule2 in scope_rules:
            if scope_overlap(rule1, rule2):
                conflicts.append(Conflict(rule1, rule2, "scope"))
    
    return conflicts
```

#### **Conflict Severity Classification**
```markdown
**Critical Conflicts**: Prevent workflow execution
- Resolution: Immediate fix required
- Example: Contradictory core workflow steps

**High Priority Conflicts**: Impact workflow effectiveness
- Resolution: Fix in current session
- Example: Different quality standards for same process

**Medium Priority Conflicts**: May cause confusion
- Resolution: Fix in next session
- Example: Inconsistent terminology

**Low Priority Conflicts**: Minor inconsistencies
- Resolution: Fix when convenient
- Example: Formatting inconsistencies
```

### **Step 3: Resolution Strategy Development**

#### **Precedence Hierarchy**
```markdown
**Level 1: Core Workflow Rules** (Highest Priority)
- Create → Validate → Test → Commit workflow
- Operator approval requirements
- Quality standards

**Level 2: Specific Process Rules** (High Priority)
- File validation procedures
- Testing requirements
- Documentation standards

**Level 3: Implementation Details** (Medium Priority)
- Tool usage guidelines
- Formatting requirements
- Naming conventions

**Level 4: Optional Enhancements** (Low Priority)
- Performance optimizations
- Additional features
- Nice-to-have improvements
```

#### **Conflict Resolution Protocols**
```markdown
**Rule 1: Specific overrides General**
- Specific rule takes precedence over general rule
- Example: "Clean up Python files" overrides "Don't clean up files"

**Rule 2: Explicit overrides Implicit**
- Explicit instructions override implicit expectations
- Example: "Prompt for approval" overrides "AI can act autonomously"

**Rule 3: Recent overrides Legacy**
- Newer rules override older rules when in conflict
- Example: Updated cleanup guidelines override previous guidelines

**Rule 4: Critical overrides Optional**
- Critical workflow rules override optional enhancements
- Example: Quality standards override performance optimizations
```

### **Step 4: Validation and Testing**

#### **Validation Test Cases**
```markdown
**Test Case 1: Autonomous vs. Explicit Actions**
- Scenario: AI wants to clean up completed file
- Expected: AI prompts for Operator approval
- Validation: Check that explicit approval rule overrides autonomous action rule

**Test Case 2: Quality Standards**
- Scenario: Multiple quality standards for same process
- Expected: Highest applicable standard is used
- Validation: Check that specific standards override general ones

**Test Case 3: Timing Conflicts**
- Scenario: Immediate action vs. approval required
- Expected: Approval requirement takes precedence
- Validation: Check that approval rules override immediate action rules
```

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### **High Risk: Breaking Existing Workflows**
- **Risk**: Conflict resolution breaks existing workflows
- **Mitigation**: Incremental validation with rollback capability
- **Fallback**: Maintain current rules until conflicts are resolved

### **Medium Risk: Rule Ambiguity**
- **Risk**: Resolution creates new ambiguities
- **Mitigation**: Clear precedence documentation and examples
- **Fallback**: Escalate to Operator for clarification

### **Low Risk: Performance Impact**
- **Risk**: Validation process slows workflow
- **Mitigation**: Efficient conflict detection algorithms
- **Fallback**: Run validation in background

## Conclusion

This validation strategy provides a systematic approach to identifying and resolving conflicts in VIBE_CODING, particularly addressing the mix of declarative and imperative rules. The strategy ensures:

1. **Comprehensive conflict detection** across all rule types
2. **Clear precedence hierarchy** for conflict resolution
3. **Consistent rule structure** for maintainability
4. **Systematic validation** for quality assurance

The plan aligns with VIBE_CODING workflow standards and ensures the instruction set remains coherent, implementable, and conflict-free. Each phase produces detailed analysis artifacts for Operator review and approval before proceeding to the next phase. The AI Agent will prompt the Operator for approval at each major milestone before taking any action.
