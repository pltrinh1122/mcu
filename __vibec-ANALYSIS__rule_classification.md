#### **If-Then Statements**
1. "If validation tools are missing, provide recommendations and ask Operator to confirm next action"
2. "If global and component-specific requirements conflict, list all conflicts and ask Operator to prioritize"
3. "If validation fails during explicit testing, provide analysis and ask Operator for guidance"
4. "If you want to override commit messages, ask Operator to provide exact message"
5. "If work is complete, proactively suggest cleanup and ask Operator for confirmation"
6. "If Operator test requests are too broad, ask for clarification"
7. "If you need to infer 'related areas' scope, ask Operator for confirmation"

#### **When-Then Statements**
- "When creating files, check for component-specific VIBE_CODING.md"
- "When validating, check component-specific validation requirements"
- "When testing, check component-specific testing requirements"
- "When committing, ensure all validation passes"

## Conflict Potential Analysis

### **High Conflict Potential Areas**

#### **1. Autonomous vs. Explicit Actions**
- **Conflict**: "AI should act autonomously" vs "Always ask Operator for approval"
- **Resolution**: Explicit approval requirements override autonomous actions

#### **2. Timing Conflicts**

- **Resolution**: Approval requirements take precedence over immediate actions

#### **3. Quality Standard Conflicts**
- **Conflict**: Different quality standards for same process
- **Resolution**: Specific standards override general ones

#### **4. Scope Conflicts**
- **Conflict**: "Do X for all files" vs "Do X only for specific file types"
- **Resolution**: Specific scope rules override general scope rules

### **Medium Conflict Potential Areas**

#### **1. Communication Standards**
- **Conflict**: Professional tone vs. casual communication
- **Resolution**: Professional tone is mandatory

#### **2. Validation Requirements**
- **Conflict**: Different validation tools for same file type
- **Resolution**: Component-specific requirements override global defaults

## Rule Quality Assessment

### **Strengths**
- **Clear Categories**: Rules are well-organized into logical categories
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major workflow areas are covered
- **Consistent Format**: Rules follow consistent formatting patterns
- **Operator Integration**: Clear handoff points to Operator

### **Areas for Improvement**
- **Ambiguity**: Some rules could be more specific
- **Redundancy**: Some rules repeat similar concepts
- **Precedence**: Clear precedence hierarchy needed
- **Exceptions**: Exception handling could be clearer

---

## Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Establish Precedence Hierarchy**: Define clear priority levels for rules
2. **Resolve Direct Conflicts**: Address contradictory instructions
3. **Standardize Format**: Ensure consistent rule formatting
4. **Document Exceptions**: Clear exception handling procedures

### **Long-term Improvements**
1. **Automated Validation**: Implement rule validation system
2. **Conflict Monitoring**: Continuous conflict detection
3. **Rule Versioning**: Track rule changes and updates
4. **Performance Optimization**: Streamline rule application

## Next Steps

This analysis provides the foundation for Phase 2: Conflict Identification and Resolution. The next phase will:

1. **Scan for Direct Conflicts**: Identify contradictory instructions
2. **Analyze Timing Conflicts**: Detect different timing requirements
3. **Identify Scope Conflicts**: Find overlapping but different scopes
4. **Flag Quality Conflicts**: Detect inconsistent quality standards

**Operator Approval Required**: Should I proceed to Phase 2: Conflict Identification and Resolution?
