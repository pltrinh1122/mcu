- Created: 2025-08-09T20:26:34Z

- Status: ARCHIVE
- Scope: docs/MCU_SPECIFICATION.md

## Objective
Add `backlog` and `backlog-item` to types and inheritance diagram.

## Steps
1. Update type lists and metadata examples
2. Extend inheritance diagram to include Backlog and Backlog Item

## Validation
- markdownlint (MD013 disabled)
- Visual check of sections
- Key Consistency: `orchestration: false` must pair with `plan_level: 1`

## Risks
- Diagram consistency; mitigate by cross-review

## Success Criteria
- Types included; diagram updated
