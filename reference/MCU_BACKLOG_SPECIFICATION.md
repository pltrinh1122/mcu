## Executive Summary

**TL;DR**: Defines the `backlog` MCU type to govern a collection of backlog items with prioritization, traceability, and basic integrity checks, enabling end-to-end flow from Notes → Backlog → Plan → Status.

## Quick Reference

### Essential Requirements
```yaml
type: backlog
audience: both
metadata: required

## Detailed Reference

### Scope and Purpose
- Govern a collection of `backlog-item` MCUs for a repository or component
- Provide prioritization and status signaling; centralize links to items

### Content Structure
- Executive Summary (purpose and scope)
- Backlog Overview (policy, prioritization scheme)
- Items Index (links to `backlog-item` MCUs)
- Reporting (optional): counts by state, aging metrics

### Quality Standards
- 100% items listed have valid links
- Clear prioritization cues (field or section)
- Timestamp accuracy (ISO 8601 UTC)

---

## Integration

### Cross-References
- Links to constituent `backlog-item` MCUs
- Optional links forward to PLAN/STATUS where applicable via items

### Validation
- Minimal structural checks: Items Index present with at least one link when non-empty

---

## Sources & Verification
- Based on MCU governance patterns and VIBE_CODING workflow

---

*Backlog MCUs establish lightweight governance for pre-execution work management.*
