## Executive Summary

**TL;DR**: Defines the `backlog-item` MCU type to represent a single backlog entry with source lineage and optional execution links to PLAN and STATUS.

## Quick Reference

### Essential Requirements
```yaml
type: backlog-item
audience: both
metadata: required
quality: governance
```

### Required Metadata
```yaml
metadata:
  context_unit_id: "backlog-item-[tool]-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[SEQ]"
  created_at: "ISO_TIMESTAMP"
  updated_at: "ISO_TIMESTAMP"
  type: "backlog-item"
  version: "[VERSION]"
  project: "MCU"
  tool: "[TOOL_NAME]"
  category: "governance"
  tags: ["backlog-item", "planning"]
```

## Detailed Reference

### Scope and Purpose
- Capture a unit of planned work with clear lineage and potential execution path

### Content Structure
- Summary (title/objective/acceptance criteria)
- Source References (links to `VIBE_NOTE` entries or docs) – at least one required
- Execution Links (optional): PLAN id/path, STATUS id/path
- Priority and sizing (optional)

### Quality Standards
- At least one source reference present
- If in execution, include PLAN link; if completed/ongoing, include STATUS link
- Timestamp accuracy (ISO 8601 UTC)

---

## Integration

### Cross-References
- Backward: source notes or docs
- Forward: links to PLAN and STATUS if applicable

### Validation
- Minimal structural checks: Source References section with ≥1 link

---

## Sources & Verification
- Based on MCU governance patterns and VIBE_CODING workflow

---

*Backlog Item MCUs provide lineage and execution linkage for planned work.*
