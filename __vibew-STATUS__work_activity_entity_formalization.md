## Current Activity: Review - PAUSED

### **Review Activity Context**
- **Activity Type**: Review entity validation against Alignment output
- **Current Focus**: Research entity specification detailed review
- **Review Topic**: Action sequences vs. execution steps for activity collection design
- **Status**: PAUSED - Operator rest break
- **Review Participants**: AI Agent (analysis) + Operator (stakeholder validation)

### **Review Progress**
- âœ… **Review Topic 1**: Action sequences vs. execution steps analysis
  - **Conclusion**: Action sequences more suitable for activity collections
  - **Rationale**: Appropriate abstraction level, composability, workflow integration
  - **Decision**: Use action sequences as activity collections

- ðŸ”„ **Review Topic 2**: Research action sequence activity mapping analysis  
  - **Status**: Analysis completed, validation confirmed
  - **Finding**: Complete coverage with existing 11 entities, no new activities required
  - **Next**: Awaiting continuation or additional review topics

### **Review Findings Summary**
1. **Framework Completeness**: 11 Work Activity Entities provide complete coverage
2. **Compositional Design**: Action sequences decompose cleanly into other entities
3. **Internal Consistency**: Research workflow validates framework design
4. **No Gaps Identified**: All research activities map to existing entity framework

## Resumption Instructions

### **Immediate Context for Resumption**
1. **Current Activity**: Review activity examining entity specifications
2. **Last Topic**: Research entity action sequence analysis completed
3. **Review Status**: Operator indicated "action sequences as activity collections makes the most sense"
4. **Analysis Completed**: Research entity action sequences map completely to existing 11 entities

### **Options for Continuation**
1. **Continue Review**: Examine additional entity specifications (Analyze, Plan, Create) for activity collection validation
2. **Conclude Review**: Operator approval of framework and transition to next phase
3. **Refine Specifications**: Apply review findings to enhance entity specifications
4. **Proceed to Phase 3**: Workflow Composition Framework development

### **Key Questions for Resumption**
1. Does the Review activity continue with additional topics?
2. Should other entity specifications be analyzed for activity collection completeness?
3. Are there framework refinements needed based on review findings?
4. Is the Review activity complete and ready for next workflow phase?

### **Framework State**
- **Design Validated**: Inheritance hierarchy and categorization confirmed
- **Specifications Complete**: All 11 entities specified with consistent template
- **Quality Validated**: Research entity analysis confirms framework completeness
- **Ready for Next Phase**: Framework foundation solid for advanced workflow development
