## Work Activity Entity Specification Template

### **Section 1: Entity Metadata**

```yaml
# Entity Identification and Classification
entity_metadata:
  entity_name: "[ENTITY_NAME]"
  entity_type: "[abstract|concrete]"
  parent_class: "[PARENT_CLASS_NAME]"
  category: "[Information|Creation|Quality|Collaboration|Finalization]"
  
  specification_metadata:
    created_date: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
    updated_date: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
    version: "X.Y"
    author: "[SPECIFICATION_AUTHOR]"
    status: "[draft|review|approved|implemented]"
    
  mcu_compliance:
    inherits_from: "[MCU inheritance chain]"
    compliance_level: "[full|partial|pending]"
    validation_status: "[validated|pending|failed]"
```

#### **Metadata Guidelines**
- **Entity Name**: Use consistent naming convention (PascalCase for class names, lowercase for file references)
- **Entity Type**: Clearly distinguish between abstract base classes and concrete implementations
- **Parent Class**: Maintain clear inheritance chain documentation
- **Compliance**: Track MCU hierarchy compliance and validation status

### **Section 2: Entity Definition**

```yaml
# Core Entity Definition
entity_definition:
  primary_purpose:
    description: "[Clear, concise statement of entity's primary purpose]"
    scope: "[Boundaries and limitations of entity responsibility]"
    differentiation: "[How this entity differs from related entities]"
  
  outcome_specification:
    primary_outcome: "[Main deliverable or result of entity execution]"
    outcome_format: "[Structure, format, or type of outcome]"
    success_criteria: "[Measurable criteria for successful completion]"
    quality_standards: "[Quality requirements for acceptable outcomes]"
  
  blocks_of_actions:
    action_sequence:
      - "[Specific action or step 1]"
      - "[Specific action or step 2]"

      - sequence_flexibility: "[rigid|flexible|optional]"
      - parallelization: "[sequential|parallel|mixed]"
      - iteration_support: "[single|iterative|recursive]"
```

#### **Definition Guidelines**
- **Purpose Clarity**: Primary purpose should be understandable without technical context
- **Outcome Specification**: Outcomes must be observable and measurable
- **Action Granularity**: Actions should be specific enough for implementation guidance
- **Success Criteria**: Must be quantifiable and verifiable

### **Section 3: Inheritance Attributes**

```yaml
# Inherited and Specialized Attributes

## Conclusion

This specification template provides a comprehensive, standardized framework for documenting Work Activity Entities that ensures consistency, completeness, and implementation readiness. The template successfully balances structure with flexibility, enabling systematic documentation while supporting the diverse needs of different entity types.

The template supports the full entity lifecycle from specification through implementation, validation, and ongoing maintenance. It provides clear guidance for extension and customization while maintaining the integrity of the inheritance hierarchy and workflow integration requirements.

**Phase 1 Complete**: All three activities of Phase 1 have been completed successfully:
- ✅ Entity categorization and orthogonal analysis
- ✅ Inheritance hierarchy definition  
- ✅ Entity specification templates

**Ready for Phase 2**: Individual entity specifications can now be created using this standardized template and the established inheritance hierarchy.

---

## Next Steps for Phase 2

Using this template, Phase 2 will create formal specifications for all 10 Work Activity Entities:
1. **Research** specification using InformationEntity template
2. **Analyze** specification using InformationEntity template
3. **Plan** specification using CreationEntity template
4. **Draft** specification using CreationEntity template
5. **Create** specification using CreationEntity template
6. **Refine** specification using CreationEntity template
7. **Validate** specification using QualityEntity template
8. **Test** specification using QualityEntity template
9. **Align** specification using CollaborationEntity template
10. **Commit** specification using FinalizationEntity template

Each specification will follow this template structure while providing concrete details for the specific entity's implementation, integration, and quality requirements.
