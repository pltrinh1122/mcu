# PLAN: P6 – Documentation Integration for Backlog Types

## 0) Plan Status Dashboard
- [DRAFT] P6 – Docs Integration [`README.md`](README.md), [`reference/README.md`](reference/README.md)

- Created: 2025-08-09T20:26:34Z
- Owner: Operator
- Status: Draft
- Scope: README.md, reference/README.md
- Orchestration: false
- Plan_Level: 1

## Objective
Document new backlog types and how to create/use them.

## Steps
1. Update top-level README directory tree and “Creating New MCUs” section
2. Update reference/README.md to include new specs

## Validation
- markdownlint (MD013 disabled)
- Key Consistency: `orchestration: false` must pair with `plan_level: 1`

## Risks
- Incomplete instructions; mitigate with concise examples and links

## Success Criteria
- Both READMEs updated and accurate
