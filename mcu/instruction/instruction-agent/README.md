# Instruction:Agent Memory Context Units

## Overview

This directory contains Instruction:Agent Memory Context Units (MCUs) designed specifically for AI-Agent behavioral guidance with dual verification (implicit AI-Agent and explicit Operator) and role-separated governance.

## Purpose

Instruction:Agent MCUs serve as AI-Agent specific guidance that:
- **Optimize AI-Agent Behavior**: Provide targeted instructions for AI-Agent execution
- **Enable Dual Verification**: Combine implicit AI-Agent and explicit Operator validation
- **Implement Governance**: Establish clear role separation and decision frameworks
- **Ensure Compliance**: Set measurable standards and performance metrics

explicit_verification:
  operator: manual_prompt
  trigger: "Review [Instruction:Agent] document. Validate understanding and compliance."
  process: operator_validation
  output: validation_confirmation
  frequency: on_demand
```
