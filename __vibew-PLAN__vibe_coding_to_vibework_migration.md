- **Created**: 2024-12-19T10:00:00Z
- **Type**: plan
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Project**: MCU
- **Tool**: VIBEWORK Migration

## Executive Summary

**TL;DR**: This plan outlines the migration from VIBE_CODING (narrow coding-focused workflow) to VIBEWORK (comprehensive knowledge work collaboration framework). The migration expands scope from code-specific tasks to all knowledge domains while maintaining existing quality standards and adding "Plan" phase to the workflow cycle.

**Key Changes:**
- **Scope Expansion**: From coding-only to all knowledge work (writing, planning, research, analysis, design)
- **Workflow Enhancement**: Add "Plan" phase (Plan → Create → Validate → Test → Commit)
- **File Naming**: Migrate from VIBE_CODING.md to VIBEWORK.md
- **Temporary Files**: Change prefix from `__vibec-` to `__vibew-`
- **Conceptual Framework**: Introduce "Alignment Architecture" and "Vibe Working" paradigm

## Clarifying Questions for Operator

### **Scope and Priorities**

1. **Domain Priority**: Which non-coding domains should we prioritize first? (writing, planning, research, analysis, design)

2. **Backward Compatibility**: Do you want to maintain backward compatibility with existing VIBE_CODING.md files, or require full migration?

3. **Tool Integration Scope**: Should we research and integrate specific validation tools for each new domain, or focus on generic quality frameworks?

4. **Migration Timeline**: Is the 10-day timeline acceptable, or do you have different timing constraints?

### **Technical Decisions**

5. **File Migration Strategy**: Should we automatically rename existing VIBE_CODING.md files to VIBEWORK.md, or provide migration guidance?

6. **Temporary File Cleanup**: Should we automatically migrate existing `__vibec-` files to `__vibew-` prefix, or leave them for manual cleanup?

7. **Component Override Compatibility**: How should component-specific VIBE_CODING.md files be handled during migration?

### **Framework Design**

8. **Alignment Architecture Detail**: How deeply should we integrate the Alignment Architecture concepts - surface level or fundamental framework change?

9. **Quality Standards**: Should quality standards remain the same (>95% success rate) or be adjusted for different knowledge domains?

10. **Validation Approach**: For non-coding domains, should validation be tool-based (like yamllint) or framework-based (like checklists)?

### **Implementation Approach**

11. **Pilot Testing**: Should we pilot VIBEWORK in a specific domain before full migration?

12. **Documentation Strategy**: Should the new VIBEWORK.md completely replace VIBE_CODING.md content, or build upon it?

13. **Cross-Reference Strategy**: Should we update all cross-references immediately, or maintain dual references during transition?

## Next Steps

**Immediate Decision Points:**
1. Approval of migration approach and timeline
2. Clarification of scope priorities and technical decisions  
3. Authorization to begin Phase 1 implementation

**Upon Approval:**
1. Begin Phase 1 implementation with file rename and basic migration
2. Research domain-specific validation tools
3. Start content transformation based on provided direction

This plan provides a structured approach to expanding VIBE_CODING into the broader VIBEWORK framework while maintaining quality standards and ensuring smooth migration.
