## Conclusion

The Align entity enables collaborative consensus building and shared understanding establishment. As the sole Collaboration category entity, Align provides essential capability for stakeholder consensus in collaborative work.

**Historical Note**: The Align entity was identified and formalized during our collaborative framework development, demonstrating the entity identification and extension process in practice.
