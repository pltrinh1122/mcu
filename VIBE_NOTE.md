## [2025-08-09T16:02:41Z] MCU Type Observations
- Scope: repository, MCU framework
- Decision/Instruction: PLAN and similar artifacts are also MCU types; SPECIFICATION is also a type of MCU; any artifact consumable by both Operator and AI should be modeled as an MCU type.
- Rationale: Ensure consistent governance, metadata, validation, and discoverability across shared artifacts.
- Actions/Next Steps:
  - Proceed with the existing PLAN to introduce the `note` MCU type.
  - Consider analogous updates to enumerate `plan` and `specification` MCU types in the base spec (pending Operator approval).
  - Keep `[LINK]` placeholders as-is and do not modify `__vibew-*` files.

## [2025-08-09T16:18:55Z] Alignment Observations
- Scope: collaboration, alignment
- Decision/Instruction:
  - MCU serves as scaffolding to enable Operator to keep up and stay aligned with Agent while collaborating.
  - Human Operators have limited memory context, which is a primary cause for misalignment and for falling behind their Agent.
- Rationale: Establish shared mental models and durable context to reduce misalignment risk.
- Actions/Next Steps: Apply MCU structure consistently to shared artifacts to maintain alignment.
- References: `VIBE_CODING.md`, `docs/MCU_SPECIFICATION.md`

## [2025-08-09T16:20:31Z] Foundational Artifacts Inquiry
- Scope: repository, foundations
- Decision/Instruction: Identify foundational artifacts required for effective Operator–Agent collaboration.
- Rationale: Ensure minimum viable scaffolding is in place across repos.
- Actions/Next Steps:
  - Confirm baseline set: `VIBE_NOTE` (note MCU), `VIBE_CODING` (instruction-agent MCU), `MCU_SPECIFICATION` (base spec), `MCU_REFERENCE_SPECIFICATION` (reference spec), `MCU_INSTRUCTION-AGENT_SPECIFICATION` (agent spec), and a plan artifact (`__vibec-PLAN__*`).
  - Decide if additional foundation is required (e.g., `README` alignment section, `CONTRIBUTING` alignment rules).

## [2025-08-09T16:24:48Z] Note Template Enhancement
- Scope: VIBE_NOTE template
- Decision/Instruction: The meta-label "Decision/Instruction" should be more general, e.g., "Body (decision/instruction/observation/etc.)"; consider a more appropriate, concise label.
- Rationale: Improve template flexibility to capture observations and other content types alongside decisions/instructions.
- Actions/Next Steps: Propose an updated template label in a follow-up change (pending Operator approval).
- References: `VIBE_NOTE.md`

<a id="note-2025-08-09T16-27-23Z"></a>
## [2025-08-09T16:27:23Z] Note Template Optimization for Operator Consumption
- Scope: VIBE_NOTE template
- Decision/Instruction: Consider optimizing the template to place the most important content first (e.g., the main body text), followed by supporting metadata fields.
- Rationale: Prioritize Operator readability and speed of comprehension during collaboration.
- Actions/Next Steps: Draft a revised template order (body-first) for review and approval.
- References: `VIBE_NOTE.md`

## [2025-08-09T18:37:49Z] README as an MCU Type
- Scope: repository structure, MCU types
- Decision/Instruction: Explore converting `README.md` into an MCU type. How would it differ from other MCUs?
- Rationale: If README is a persistent cross-audience artifact, modeling it as an MCU type may align governance, metadata, and validation.
- Actions/Next Steps:
  - Draft a proposal outlining a `readme` MCU type vs. using existing `reference` type with a special role.
  - Compare metadata, content structure, and quality requirements.
  - Recommend whether to keep README as conventional repo doc or formalize as a specialized MCU.
- References: `README.md`, `docs/MCU_SPECIFICATION.md`, `reference/MCU_REFERENCE_SPECIFICATION.md`

<a id="note-2025-08-09T18-42-21Z"></a>
## [2025-08-09T18:42:21Z] Explore Layer for Defining Used MCU Artifacts
- Scope: repository framework, layering
- Decision/Instruction: Explore the right layer (e.g., `VIBE_WORK`) MCU type responsible for defining the set of used MCU artifacts (e.g., `VIBE_CODING`, `VIBE_NOTE`, `README`, etc.).
- Rationale: Centralizing artifact definitions at the proper layer can improve discoverability, governance, and consistency across projects.
- Actions/Next Steps:
  - Draft a `VIBE_WORK` (or similar) MCU type concept with metadata to enumerate adopted artifacts and their roles.
  - Compare against existing `reference`/`instruction` scopes to prevent overlap.
  - Propose directory placement and template changes if adopted.
- References: `VIBE_CODING.md`, `docs/MCU_SPECIFICATION.md`, `README.md`

## [2025-08-09T18:44:12Z] VIBE_NOTE Usage and Roles
- Scope: VIBE_NOTE governance
- Decision/Instruction: Clarify VIBE_NOTE lifecycle and responsibilities.
  - Create: Operator or AI can create entries; AI should propose, Operator approves sensitive items.
  - Update: New entries are appended; existing timestamps are not retroactively changed unless explicitly approved by Operator.
  - Remove: Deletions require explicit Operator approval; AI may propose cleanup.
  - Timestamping: Always use ISO 8601 UTC (e.g., `2025-08-09T18:44:12Z`).
- Rationale: Ensure consistent, auditable collaboration and traceability.
- Actions/Next Steps: Reflect this lifecycle in `VIBE_CODING.md` usage guidance and in any future Note MCU spec.
- References: `VIBE_CODING.md`, `__vibec-PLAN__vibe_note_mcu_extension.md`

## [2025-08-09T18:46:07Z] MCU Quick-Start for Cursor (Guide)
- Scope: onboarding, workspace setup
- Decision/Instruction: Explore creating an "MCU Quick-Start for Cursor" GUIDE (as an MCU type) to set up an MCU framework in a new or existing workspace.
- Rationale: Accelerate adoption by providing step-by-step setup tailored for Cursor.
- Actions/Next Steps:
  - Draft the GUIDE scope: prerequisites, directory creation, templates, validation/testing, commit practices.
  - Decide on MCU type: dedicated `guide` type vs. `reference` with a Quick-Start role.
  - Propose placement (e.g., `guides/` dir or under `reference/`) and a template.
- References: `README.md`, `VIBE_CODING.md`, `docs/MCU_SPECIFICATION.md`, `templates/`

<a id="note-2025-08-09T18-49-23Z"></a>
## [2025-08-09T18:49:23Z] PLAN Context Switching
- Scope: workflow governance
- Decision/Instruction: Decide whether context switching between PLANs is supported and how.
- Rationale: Multi-threaded work may require pausing/resuming plans without losing alignment.
- Actions/Next Steps:
  - Define allowed states: Active, Paused, Completed, Abandoned.
  - Specify switch protocol: record pause reason, capture current state, next steps, and timestamp; update STATUS; add note in `VIBE_NOTE.md`.
  - Outline limits: maximum concurrent active plans; Operator approval required for switching.
- References: `__vibec-PLAN__*`, `__vibew-STATUS__*`, `VIBE_CODING.md`

## [2025-08-09T19:17:57Z] Reconcile Vibe Work and Vibe Project
- Scope: layering, governance
- Decision/Instruction: Reconcile relationship and boundaries between Vibe Work (operational layer) and Vibe Project (organizational/product layer).
- Rationale: Clear delineation will reduce ambiguity in artifact ownership, lifecycle, and cross-repo integration.
- Actions/Next Steps:
  - Draft definitions: purposes, audiences, and responsibilities of each layer.
  - Map artifacts to layers (e.g., `VIBE_CODING`, `VIBE_NOTE`, `README`) and define cross-links.
  - Propose governance rules for handoffs and escalation across layers.

<a id="note-2025-08-09T19-35-49Z"></a>
## [2025-08-09T19:35:49Z] Default Permissioning Labels for MCU Attributes
- Scope: governance, permissions
- Decision/Instruction: Evaluate default permissioning labels for MCU attributes to determine which require explicit Operator approval vs. which are implicitly updated by the Agent.
- Rationale: Reduce friction and ambiguity by codifying attribute-level authority.
- Actions/Next Steps:
  - Draft a matrix proposing defaults, e.g., implicit: `Created`, `Updated`, `Tags`; explicit: `Type`, `Version`, `Project`, `Tool`, `Category`, cross-references.
  - Integrate into base spec and VIBE_CODING governance once approved.
- References: `docs/MCU_SPECIFICATION.md`, `VIBE_CODING.md`

<a id="note-2025-08-09T19-38-56Z"></a>
## [2025-08-09T19:38:56Z] VIBE_BACKLOG MCU Type
- Scope: backlog, planning
- Decision/Instruction: Add a new MCU type, `VIBE_BACKLOG`, to track PLANs and corresponding STATUS. Each backlog item should reference source information (e.g., VIBE_NOTE entries) that are groomed into PLAN items.
- Rationale: Provide traceability from Notes → Backlog → Plan → Status, improving governance and accountability.
- Actions/Next Steps:
  - Draft `MCU_BACKLOG_SPECIFICATION.md` and a corresponding template.
  - Define metadata to link to source notes, plan IDs, and status documents.
  - Update validator to recognize `backlog` type or ignore if treated as non-MCU family.
- References: `VIBE_CODING.md`, `__vibec-PLAN__*`, `__vibew-STATUS__*`, `docs/MCU_SPECIFICATION.md`

<a id="note-2025-08-09T19-51-22Z"></a>
## [2025-08-09T19:51:22Z] SPECIFICATION MCU Type Relationship
- Scope: types, relationships
- Decision/Instruction: Explore a dedicated `specification` MCU type’s role and its relationships to other types (reference, instruction, instruction-agent, note, backlog?).
- Rationale: Clarify whether specifications should govern templates and validators directly, define inheritance and extension points, and set cross-type constraints.
- Actions/Next Steps:
  - Draft a mapping of which types inherit from which specification and what constraints they must satisfy.
  - Determine cross-reference requirements (e.g., specs must reference base spec and relevant templates).
  - Recommend updates to `docs/MCU_SPECIFICATION.md` and per-type specs.
- References: `docs/MCU_SPECIFICATION.md`, `reference/MCU_NOTE_SPECIFICATION.md`, `instruction/instruction-agent/MCU_INSTRUCTION-AGENT_SPECIFICATION.md`

## [2025-08-09T20:10:23Z] Strategy/Analysis in PLAN and PLAN-of-PLAN
- Scope: planning methodology
- Decision/Instruction: Add a “Strategy/Analysis” section to PLAN and PLAN-of-PLAN documents to contextualize objectives (answer “Why?”), including constraints, alternatives considered, and rationale for choice.
- Rationale: Improves alignment, reduces rework, and clarifies trade-offs and success criteria.
- Actions/Next Steps:
  - Update `VIBE_CODING.md` (“When Developing Plans”) to include Strategy/Analysis as a required section.
  - Add guidance prompts (problem statement, options, trade-offs, selection rationale).
- References: `VIBE_CODING.md`

## [2025-08-09T20:52:48Z] Business Rule Validation Scripts Organization
- Scope: validation, tooling
- Decision/Instruction: Consider organizing business rule validators per MCU family/type (e.g., `validate_pop.py`) or integrating as modules within `validate_mcu.py`.
- Rationale: Separate policy/business rules from base structural checks; enable targeted execution.
- Actions/Next Steps:
  - Draft module structure (e.g., `validators/policy/pop.py`) and an entrypoint pattern in `validate_mcu.py`.
  - Evaluate performance and usability impacts.
- References: `scripts/validate_mcu.py`
<a id="note-2025-08-10T00-12-24Z"></a>
## [2025-08-10T00:12:24Z] Explore alternative structure for validate_mcu.py
- Body: Should we keep it as a single monolithic .py file, or modularize?
- Scope: validation tooling, repository scripts
- Actions/Next Steps: Draft options (monolithic vs modular), outline pros/cons, propose migration path if modular
- References:

## [2025-08-10T01:19:21Z] RACI-MCU for Operator–Agent and Inter-Pair Collaboration
- Body: Need a "RACI-MCU" to define and govern Operator and Agent collaboration (Pair) as well as inter-Pair collaboration. Leverage the MCU_REFERENCE to track the evolution of RACI and other roles and responsibilities for us to ride the updates.
- Scope: governance, roles & responsibilities
- Actions/Next Steps:
  - Draft RACI-MCU scope and initial roles matrix
  - Propose where to host (reference vs specification) and cross-links
  - Define update process to follow MCU_REFERENCE evolutions
- References: `reference/MCU_REFERENCE_SPECIFICATION.md`, `VIBE_CODING.md`

<a id="note-2025-08-10T01-44-20Z"></a>
## [2025-08-10T01:44:20Z] PLAN sharing guidance
- Body: The only PLAN content that we would consider sharing would be the unique and new sequence of STEP, i.e., an optimized way to solve a specific problem (e.g., PLAN for refactoring Python vs. PLAN for editing books). We should consider a script or ability to convert the current PLAN into a "template" for re-use and not to reuse the current PLAN itself.
- Scope: planning, reuse
- Actions/Next Steps:
  - Identify candidate PLANs whose Steps are generally reusable
  - Add a converter to extract Steps into `templates/` as reusable patterns
  - Document guidance to link templates, not copy full PLANs
- References: `templates/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`, `templates/PLAN_STEP_TEMPLATE.md`, `VIBE_CODING.md`

## [2025-08-10T04:36:13Z] BLIT Converter Test Coverage Plan
- Body: Expand unit tests for `blit_convert.py` beyond a single sample to cover schema variance and edge-cases.
- Scope: testing, validation
- Actions/Next Steps:
  - Required/optional fields: missing keys, extra keys (additionalProperties), empty strings → null normalization.
  - Tracks variants: each track state, all unset, mixed null/"".
  - Source references: multiple links, unusual URLs, missing section handling.
  - Execution links: PLAN/POP/STATUS present/absent permutations.
  - Titles/content: Unicode, long strings, special characters.
  - Canonical JSON block: present/absent; round-trip preserves block; schema_version mismatch behavior.
  - Filenames/SystemID: valid/invalid patterns; case sensitivity.
  - Modes & paths: --out-dir, single-file vs directory inputs.
  - Real-data suite: round-trip all `BACKLOGS/ITEMS/BLIT_*.md` and assert semantic equality.
  - Negative cases: invalid schema fails; malformed markdown handled gracefully.
- References: `backlog-item/blit_convert.py`, `backlog-item/blit_schema.json`, `backlog-item/test_blit_convert.py`

<a id="note-2025-08-10T04-39-49Z"></a>
## [2025-08-10T04:39:49Z] blit_convert --test option
- Body: Enhance `blit_convert.py` with a `--test` flag that accepts an input `.md` or `.json` and validates semantic equality post-conversion (round-trip), failing with non-zero exit code on mismatch.
- Scope: tooling, testing
- Actions/Next Steps:
  - Implement `--test` for both directions (md→json→md and json→md→json)
  - Support `--out-dir` for temporary outputs; default to a temp folder
  - Print a concise diff of semantic objects when unequal
- References: `backlog-item/blit_convert.py`, `backlog-item/test_blit_convert.py`
