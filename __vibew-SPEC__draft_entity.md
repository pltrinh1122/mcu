## Section 1: Entity Metadata

```yaml
entity_metadata:
  entity_name: "Draft"
  entity_type: "concrete"
  parent_class: "CreationEntity"
  category: "Creation"
  
  mcu_compliance:
    inherits_from: "WorkActivityEntity → CreationEntity → Draft"
    compliance_level: "full"
    validation_status: "validated"
```

## Section 2: Entity Definition

```yaml
entity_definition:
  primary_purpose:
    description: "Preliminary artifact creation suitable for iteration, feedback, and refinement before final implementation"
    scope: "Creating initial versions of work artifacts that capture core concepts while remaining open to modification"
    differentiation: "Focuses on preliminary creation for iteration, distinct from Plan (strategy) and Create (final artifacts)"
  
  outcome_specification:
    primary_outcome: "Initial artifact version suitable for review, feedback, and iterative improvement"
    outcome_format: "Preliminary artifact with core elements implemented and clear areas for refinement identified"
    success_criteria: 
      - "Core concepts and structure clearly represented"
      - "Sufficient detail for meaningful review and feedback"
      - "Areas for improvement and refinement identified"
      - "Ready for iteration based on feedback"
    quality_standards:
      - "Functionally coherent even if incomplete"
      - "Clearly communicates intended direction"
      - "Open to modification without major restructuring"
      - "Provides solid foundation for refinement"
```

## Section 3: Implementation Specification (Abbreviated)

```yaml
ai_agent_implementation:
  autonomous_capabilities:
    - "Create preliminary versions using established patterns and templates"
    - "Implement core functionality while flagging areas for refinement"
    - "Document design decisions and areas requiring feedback"
    - "Organize draft for effective review and iteration"
  
  operator_required:
    - "Define draft scope and acceptable completion level"
    - "Provide feedback for iterative improvement"
    - "Approve transition from draft to final creation"
    - "Guide refinement priorities and direction"
```

## Section 4: Workflow Integration

```yaml
workflow_integration:
  composition_patterns:
    typical_workflows:
      - workflow_name: "Iterative Development"
        sequence: "Plan → Draft → Review → Refine → Draft → Create → Validate → Commit"
        description: "Multiple draft cycles enable iterative improvement"
      
      - workflow_name: "Rapid Prototyping"
        sequence: "Research → Draft → Test → Draft → Create → Review → Commit"
        description: "Quick drafts enable early testing and validation"
```

## Conclusion

The Draft entity enables iterative creation through preliminary artifact development suitable for feedback and refinement. As a Creation category entity, Draft provides the critical capability for exploration and iteration before final implementation.

_This specification implements the Work Activity Entity framework standards for Draft entity implementation within the VIBEWORK ecosystem._
